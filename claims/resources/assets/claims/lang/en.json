  "claimsguide-text": "<strong>General</strong><br>Mod divides world map to plots with size 16x16xWorldHeight. For this plot can be set rights for groups of players. There are 3 types of rights for plot: <i>build/destroy</i>, <i>use</i> and <i>damage against protected animals</i>. There are 4 groups for which can be set right: <i>citizen</i>, <i>ally</i>, <i>stranger</i>,<i>friend</i>.<br>    There are 3 main structures in the mod: Village, City and Alliance.<br> <strong>Village</strong> is just 1 protected plot with lower price of creation, but without possibility for pvp, firespread and blast to be turned off. Village also will be deleted after specific amount of time(default 1 real week).<br> <strong>City</strong> can have more plots. Number of availible plots depends on population of the city. For city plots can be turned off/on pvp, firespread, blast (no-pvp flag can have additional payment).<br> <strong>Alliance</strong> contain at least 1 city and can declare wars to other alliancies.<br><br><strong>Economy</strong><br>Chest-banks are used by players, cities and alliancies. For creation a new one you need to place a chest and place sign on one of its side [west/east/south/north] side. Then you need to write for player chest-bank<br>   <strong>[player]Yournickname</strong><br>For city:<br>   <strong>[city]Cityname</strong><br>For alliance:<br>   <strong>[alliance]Alliancename</strong><br><br>If there is not enough place for name on the first line - just continue on the next. Click button save then. If everything is ok, you should get a message, that chest-bank was created. After succesfull chest-bank creation you can remove sign.(If you saved sign content but there is no messages at all, save it again).<br> Only player can create his own chest-bank, city chest-bank can be created only by it's mayor, alliance only by it's leader. City chest-bank can be created only on city plot. Alliance chest-bank only on plot of the alliance city. To delete chest-bank break the chest.<br><br>If player doesn't have chest-bank created his inventory will be used, for example for city creation or plot claiming. But if you go offline and doesn't have a chest-bank you won't be able to pay fee for your plots.<br><br><strong>Plot types</strong><br><strong>Summon</strong> in the borders of this plot can be set a teleportation point. By default near this point should stay 2 other players to summon player who use it.<br><strong>Prison</strong> is a plot, where criminals of the city will be teleported if they are killd in the borders of city plots by citizens with \"militia\" rank.<br><strong>Embassy</strong> other plot types can be claimed by citizen of the city. This plot type can be claimed by anyony, even without any city.<br><strong>Tavern</strong> only in this type plot can be created innerclaim.<br><br><strong>City plots group</strong><br>In this group can be invited any player(from your city, other city, without city), plots of the city can be assign to this group and everyony from this group will have access to this plots. Same way as permission set for plots they can be set for this groups. Also for group can be set fee, which will be payed by evey member of the group.<br><br><strong>GUI</strong><br>To open use \"P\". There is info for your city/village/alliance and tab with part of existing commands (other you can find on the forum page now)",
